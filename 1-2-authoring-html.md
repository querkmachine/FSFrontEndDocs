Unless you’re coding an HTML email (may god have mercy on your soul) then you should be writing in valid, semantic HTML5. 

Using semantically correct HTML is important. Assistive technologies and search engines use the inherent meanings of different HTML tags in order to effectively navigate and index the page contents. Remember: `<div>` and `<span>` are the *only* HTML tags with no intrinsic meaning, everything else does—so make sure you're using them correctly! 

HTML5 Doctor has [a handy reference](http://html5doctor.com/element-index/) as to what each tag represents.
