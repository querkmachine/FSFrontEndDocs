title: Browser and device support
---

Browser support requirements differ depending on the needs of the project, however we typically build only for browsers that are still officially supported by their vendors. (This means you don't need to support IE8 anymore, thank god.)

Our device testing methods are a lot more freeform. We have a significant number of devices which can normally be found with Vishnu, but don’t worry about finding every edge case yourself, as that’s a job that the testing team will carry out for you.

As a standard we support the following mobile operating systems:

* iOS 8 and above
* Android 4.2 and above 
* Windows Phone 8 and above
* Windows 10 Mobile and above
