title: User experience

User experience (or UX) as a concept can best be summed up with the phrase [‘don’t make me think’](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)—somewhat ironic given that good UX takes quite a lot of thought. Understanding the intricacies of UX as a whole would require hundreds of pages of reading and probably a degree in psychology, so in lieu of that prepare yourself for the quickest seminar in [Don Norman’s design principles](https://twobenches.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/don-normans-design-principles/) ever written. 

**Visibility**: Makes things visible. Seriously. <mark>Avoid hiding functionality or content</mark> inside dropdowns, accordions and carousels. When looking for something a person will scan the page with their eyes, and they’ll struggle to find things if explicit interaction is required to find it. 

**Constraint**: <mark>Show the user what they can do</mark>, and ONLY what they can do. However, do not hide controls completely or you'll breach the Visibility rule. Just give them a 'disabled' visual state instead.

**Consistency**: Design similar operations to use similar functions to achieve similar tasks. An interface that follows rules (and follows them consistently) is one that a user will be able to learn quickly and navigate confidently. <mark>Eliminate exceptions wherever possible.</mark>

**Feedback**: <mark>Give the user feedback on what is going on within the system.</mark> This affirms to the user that something is happening and that their actions have worked as intended (or otherwise not). Error messages, success messages, loading bars and progress animations all reinforce this. 

**Affordance**: Perhaps an oversimplification, but basically means that <mark>something should be designed for the specific task it fulfils</mark>. A simple computer mouse, for example, only has two interactions: move and click. The functions of the mouse are implied by the design of the mouse.  

**Mapping**: To continue the mouse allusion, <mark>controls should ‘map’ to an obvious and sensible outcome</mark>. Moving the mouse upwards moves the cursor upwards, clicking the button activates whatever the cursor is pointing at, etc.

Unfortunately a lot of our work is in the capacity of a development agency, not a design one, so the visual appearance of what we’re building is often set in stone. Regardless, if you find something that is blatantly horrible we *absolutely* encourage you to try and apply some of the above principles to make things nicer for the end user; and if you can’t, just <mark>kick and scream and raise hell until it gets done properly</mark>. That’s also good.
