User experience (or UX) as a concept can best be summed up with the phrase [‘don’t make me think’](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)—somewhat ironic given that good UX takes quite a lot of thought.

<aside class="aside aside--issue">
Unfortunately, a lot of our work is in the capacity of a development agency, not a design one, so the visual appearance of what we’re building is often set in stone. Regardless, if you find something that is blatantly horrible we *absolutely* encourage you to try and apply some of the below principles to make things nicer for the end user; and if you can’t, just **kick and scream and raise hell until it gets done properly**. That’s also good.

## Norman's user-centric design principles

Understanding the intricacies of UX as a whole would require hundreds of pages of reading and probably a degree in psychology, so in lieu of that prepare yourself for the quickest seminar in [Don Norman’s design principles](https://twobenches.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/don-normans-design-principles/) ever written. 

### Visibility

Makes things visible. Seriously. **Avoid hiding functionality or content** inside dropdowns, accordions and carousels. 

When looking for something a person will scan the page with their eyes, and they’ll struggle to find things if an explicit interaction is required to find it. 

### Constraint

**Show the user what they can do**, and *only* what they can do. 

However, do not hide controls completely or you'll breach the visibility rule. Give temporarily unavailable controls a visible disabled state instead.

### Consistency

Design similar operations to use similar functions to achieve similar tasks. An interface that follows rules (and follows them consistently) is one that a user will be able to learn quickly and navigate confidently. **Eliminate exceptions wherever possible.**

In web design, using pattern libraries and design systems aids in creating 'internal' consistency. In mobile and application design, adhering to established design guidelines for the relevant system creates 'external' consistency. 

### Feedback

**Give the user feedback on what is going on within the system.** This affirms to the user that something is happening and that their actions have worked as intended (or otherwise not). Error messages, success messages, loading bars and progress animations all reinforce this. 

### Affordance

Perhaps an oversimplification, but basically means that **something should be designed for the specific task it fulfils**. 

In website design this is considered from a visual perspective; Links and buttons should look like they can be clicked, for example. This can be with the application of skeuomorphism, for example, having a credit card details form visually resemble a credit card.

### Mapping

Simply put, **controls should map to an obvious and sensible outcome**. Scrolling up should scroll the page upwards. Left clicking an anchor should take you to another page. Conforming to expectations makes using the user interface feel natural to use, subverting expectations creates confusion.
