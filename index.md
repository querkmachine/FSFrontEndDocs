Hello! If you’re reading this, you either [work here](http://felinesoft.com/), have been contracted by us to do some front-end work for us, or heck, you could even be some curious passer-by. Alternatively you could be a hacker who has compromised our systems (naughty!) but if that’s the case then there’s probably much more interesting things to look at than this. 

This guide exists as a (hopefully) brief and (hopefully) helpful overview of how we handle HTML, control CSS and maintain dominant jurisdiction over JavaScript. It also contains plenty of bad jokes, just to keep things interesting. 

To emphasise the first sentence of that paragraph: **This is a guide.** There is no single right way to do things, and if you’re working on legacy code or an inherited project there’s a good chance it won’t have had a chance to take the medicine that this guide prescribes. In these situations it's typically better to continue using whatever convention has been established there—**consistency is more important than correctness**—but that’s up to your discretion. 

With that out of the way, what would you like to know?
