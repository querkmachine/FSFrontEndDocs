title: Build tools

We absolutely, unequivocally, forever and ever always will with a cherry on top (at least at the time of writing this document) use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com). Not to hate on any other build tool, but we tried Grunt for a while, and while some of our older projects might still be using it, we’ve definitely settled on that big red cup of love as our front-end toolchain of choice. 

A project’s typical Gulpfile will probably [look something like this](https://github.com/querkmachine/kickstart/blob/master/gulpfile.js) (in fact, that's the basis for our company's front-end boilerplate) but none of those npm modules are required to be used; feel free to <mark>use something else if you think there’s a compelling technical or practical reason</mark> to do so.
