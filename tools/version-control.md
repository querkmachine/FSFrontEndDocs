## Front-end assets

Many of our projects have front-ends that work on the principle of having a source (`src`) directory and a destination (`dst` or `dist`) directory. 

The source directory contains the raw assets for the project, such as Sass code, TypeScript, unoptimised images, etc. It is the only one that is directly modified and should be stored in source control.

The destination directory has everything that is needed for the website to function in a browser. Compiled CSS, JavaScript, optimised images and the like go in here. **Destination directories should not be in source control, and their contents should be entirely generated by build tools** on both developer machines and the build server.

Basically: Source should be the only one that needs to be in source control, destination should be the only one that needs to be deployed. And never the twain shall meet. 

## git

All new projects use [git](https://git-scm.com) and [git flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/). You're encouraged to create feature branches for any significant new work, merging those branches into `develop` upon completion. 

There is currently no company-wide code review and pull request system. 

## Team Foundation Version Control

Many historical projects use Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for managing code. It's basically Microsoft's fork of Subversion. It sucks. The differences between git and TFVC, while not radical, may trip some people up. [There's an extensive, technical list on Microsoft's website](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc).

In git you'd normally prepare a number of commits before pushing them collectively to the remote server. **In TFVC you 'check in' code, which is equivalent to committing and pushing simultaneously.** 

Branching in TFVC create a duplication of the entire project in a separate directory, meaning you're going to need to change any configuration settings (such as those in <abbr title="Internet Information Services Manager">IIS</abbr>) before making any changes. Merging branches back into trunk is also an exercise in pain. Avoid unnecessarily branching where possible.
